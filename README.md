   <h1>Wordle</h1>
   <h3>A recreation of Wordle in React Native</h3>
   <br />
   <p>This is my first project using React or any related framework, and this project was primarily made for me to get familiar with Expo, React Native, TypeScript, and React in general</p>

   <h2>Features</h2>
   <p>- Features a hundred different words for the game to randomly from (locally)</p>
   <p>- Guessing & typing mechanics</p>
   <p>- Letters appear green, yellow, or gray depending on if it is in the right place, wrong place, or not in the word at all</p>
   <p>- Pretty much Wordle, except you can get a new word by restarting the app or playing again at the end of the game</p>
